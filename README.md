# Guido - JavaScript library for Webex Device UIs

Guido is a JavaScript SDK for user interfaces on Webex Devices. It is designed for integrations such as macros or Node integrations.

The library contains two independent components **(see links in right sidebar)**

* UI - for running the xAPI commands that manipulates the UI in runtime and listen to events

* UI Builder - for creating dynamic user interface extensions

The two libraries can be used completely independently or together. You can install them as macro modules on the video device, by importing the two files `src/ui.js` and `src/ui-builder.js` in the macro editor.
